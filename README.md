# seasonal-fruits-api

Inspired by #100devs, this repo is a very basic but functioning web app deployed on heroku with its own API. The endpoints are listed below for immediate access, and I've included a landing page with links to bump that user experience up a notch ;)

Full API:
https://fruits-api-100devs.herokuapp.com/api

Winter Fruits:
https://fruits-api-100devs.herokuapp.com/api/winter

Spring Fruits:
https://fruits-api-100devs.herokuapp.com/api/spring

Summer Fruits:
https://fruits-api-100devs.herokuapp.com/api/summer

Fall Fruits:
https://fruits-api-100devs.herokuapp.com/api/fall

## Future Dev:
- Add routes to search deeper into â€ he API.
- Add more seasonal information
